when we write without quotes the word replace var but the problem is that bash splits words based on space.
for example after replacing the value of var we have : hello mom="test"
here the word hello mom is supposed to be a single operand and test should be the second operand and = as our operator.
however bacause we don't have quotes bash treat hello and mom as separate words
that means only hello becomes the first operand and mom is considered unknown which will cause an error.
